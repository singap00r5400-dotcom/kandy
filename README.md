🌿 AI Crop Disease Detection System (Flask Web App)

Description:
A prototype web application that simulates crop leaf disease detection and provides basic treatment and prevention advice. Built using Flask with a simple HTML/CSS interface. Predictions are currently generated using random selection (no real AI model yet).

Features:

Upload leaf image

Detects: Healthy, Leaf Blight, Rust, Mildew

Displays treatment & prevention tips

Simple and clean user interface

Technologies Used:

Python, Flask

HTML, CSS

NumPy

Project Structure:

app.py – Flask backend

index.html – User interface

style.css – Styling

proto.py – Console prototype

How It Works:
User uploads an image → Flask processes request → Disease predicted → Advice displayed on webpage

Future Scope:

Integrate real ML model (CNN)

Train with plant disease dataset

Add confidence score

Mobile-friendly interface

Use Case:
College mini project | Agriculture technology demo | AI prototype
